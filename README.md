# rock-paper-scissors-javascript-study


As of right now, this is a simple game of rock-paper-scissors that can be played against a computer in the console. Multiple functions, a map, and switch statements are used to handle the logic of the game. In the playGame() function, insert the number of rounds you want to play.

Since this is only in the console, in the future, I play to add a user interface on the web.
